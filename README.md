# Sexist Detection in Sentences
 The project focuses on identifying signs of sexism in texts through three tasks: identifying sexism, categorizing sexism, and sub-categorizing sexism. The best model used for completing these tasks is RoBERTa pre-trained on hate speech with the addition of data augmentation and learning rate scheduler techniques.
